# skips

A SpinKube Improvement Proposal (SKIP) is a way to propose, communicate and
coordinate changes for the SpinKube project.

## Quickstart

1) Socialize an idea with the relevant maintainers, you can reach out to people
privately, via the #spinkube channel in the CNCF Slack, or by joining a SpinKube
community meeting and adding it to the agenda.
2) Follow the process outlined in the SKIP Template.
